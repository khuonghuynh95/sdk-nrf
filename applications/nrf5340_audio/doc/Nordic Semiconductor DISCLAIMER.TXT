How to identify PRELIMINARY versions

The Nordic Semiconductor versioning system generally includes 3 parameters
------ MAJOR.MINOR.ID ------

-- MAJOR identifies an important feature change that may involve non-backwards compatibility
-- MINOR identifies minor feature change, keeping backwards compatibility
-- ID normally identifies simple bug fixes


PRELIMINARY versions can be identified with MAJOR version number lower than "1"
For example
0.7.1: Is a PRELIMINARY version
0.8.4: Is a PRELIMINARY version
1.0.0: Is an Official release
